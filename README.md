# What do we want to find out?

Here are some things we want to know about the penguins:

- Which island has the most penguins? Which island has the most Adelie
  penguins?
- Is there a relationship between bill length and bill depth? For
  example, do penguins with longer bills also have deeper bills?
- Do female penguins have longer or shorter flippers than male penguins?
- Which species of penguin has the longest flippers?
- How heavy is the heaviest penguin? Which species is the heaviest?
- Anything else you want to find out!

Work with your group to make a chart or a table answering your question.
